## lyrics_finder

This is a little project using musixmatch's API. It is the light version so it does not return all the lyrics haha.

### To use (windows, python 3.8):

pip install tkinter

import tkinter as tk

from tkinter import StringVar

import requests


It is very simple right now. Type in a song name and a song artist and get some lyrics back.

Ps. Project I coded from class
